# ResNet_50_enhanced_for_CRC_image_classification

To run the demo, download the following files:
- [ResNet50.model]
- [best_weights.h5]

After downloading, place the files in the project directory and run the demo script.

Guide: 
Both the "NCT-CRC-HE-100K" training dataset and "CRC-VAL-HE-7K" Dataset can be downloaded from the folwing link: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1214456

The Demo File will validate the CRC-VAL-HE-7K results at the end the overall accuracy and a browser link will appear to classify single images of CRC that satasify the input requirments of the model.
Model file is the training folder
