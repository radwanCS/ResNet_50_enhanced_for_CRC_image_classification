# ResNet_50_enhanced_for_CRC_image_classification

To run the demo, download the following files:
- [ResNet50.model]
- [best_weights.h5]

After downloading, place the files in the project directory and run the demo script. You will also need to install the requirments before running the demo.

Guide: 
Both the "NCT-CRC-HE-100K" training dataset and "CRC-VAL-HE-7K" Dataset can be downloaded from the folwing link: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1214456

You can download few images for testing from the provided databases

The Demo File will validate the CRC-VAL-HE-7K results at the end the overall accuracy and a browser link will appear to classify single images of CRC that satasify the input requirments of the model.

I will upload AI pathologist exe (the CPU and GPU version) later. Which can run on win10/11 without any dependencies or additional setup.
